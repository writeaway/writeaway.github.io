Lines will continue until a point where a newline would\n                be preserved if it were present.\n\n    end_with_newline (default false)  - end output with a newline\n\n\n    e.g\n\n    js_beautify(js_source_text, {\n      'indent_size': 1,\n      'indent_char': '\\t'\n    });\n\n*/\n\n// Object.values polyfill found here:\n// http://tokenposts.blogspot.com.au/2012/04/javascript-objectkeys-browser.html\nif (!Object.values) {\n    Object.values = function(o) {\n        if (o !== Object(o)) {\n            throw new TypeError('Object.values called on a non-object');\n        }\n        var k = [],\n            p;\n        for (p in o) {\n            if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o, p)) {\n                k.push(o[p]);\n            }\n        }\n        return k;\n    };\n}\n\n(function() {\n\n    function js_beautify(js_source_text, options) {\n\n        var acorn = {};\n        (function(exports) {\n            /* jshint curly: false */\n            // This section of code is taken from acorn.\n            //\n            // Acorn was written by Marijn Haverbeke and released under an MIT\n            // license.
